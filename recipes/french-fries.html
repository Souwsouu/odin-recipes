    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French fries are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes.</p>
    <p>The best potatoes for French fries are soaked in a sugar solution before frying.</p>
    <p>The sugar solution has something to do with the carbohydrates and prevents the potatoes from soaking up a lot of grease, so they get crunchy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large russet potatoes - peeled, and sliced</li>
        <li>6 cupes vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together warm water and sugar in a medium bowl. Soak potatoes in water mixture for 15 minutes. Remove potatoes from water and dry thoroughly on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cook potatoes in hot oil until golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels and season with salt.</li>
    </ol>
